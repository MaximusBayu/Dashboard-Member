This is a Next.js projext about member dashboard. In this app we can login as Admin and Member. The Admin can manage the members, while the member can edit their profile. The purpose of this app is to keep track of current member.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

For the API itself, you can use (NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL) for your own ```.env.local```.
